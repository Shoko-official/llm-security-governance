# Contributing

Work in this repository must stay small, reviewable, and tied to an issue.

## Branches

Use short branch names tied to the issue:

```text
docs/security/<issue-id>-short-name
feat/security/<issue-id>-short-name
fix/security/<issue-id>-short-name
```

Do not work directly on `main`.

## Pull Requests

Each pull request must:

* link to an issue;
* stay small and focused;
* describe scope and out-of-scope work;
* list changed files;
* list validation commands and results;
* avoid unrelated refactors;
* avoid secrets and private data.

Use `Closes #<issue>` only when the pull request fully completes the issue.
Use `Refs #<issue>` or `Part of #<issue>` for partial work.

## Review Rules

Review should check:

* scope matches the linked issue;
* no security compliance content appears before the right milestone;
* claims are evidence-backed or clearly marked unresolved;
* figures follow the project figure policy;
* validation commands pass.

## Evidence Rules

Do not introduce security claims as final content unless they are backed by
approved research ledger material.

Planning notes are allowed only when clearly marked as not paper-ready.

## Figure Rules

Figures must be either:

* Mermaid source files; or
* Python-generated images from an approved workflow.

Do not add external images, screenshots, hand-drawn diagrams, or binary figures
without a dedicated issue.

## Local Checks

After validation is introduced, run:

```bash
make validate
make lint
make test
```
